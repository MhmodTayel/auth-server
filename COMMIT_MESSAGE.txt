feat: add SSL/HTTPS support with nginx and domain configuration

## Changes

### 🔧 CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed lowercase Docker image names for GHCR compliance
- Added automatic copy of docker-compose.prod.yml to EC2
- Improved deployment verification to check from within EC2
- Fixed health check to test internal localhost connection

### 🌐 SSL & Domain Support
- Added nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Integrated Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Added certbot for automatic certificate renewal
- Created Docker Compose profiles for flexible deployment:
  - Default: backend + mongodb
  - with-ssl: adds nginx + certbot
  - with-frontend: adds frontend container

### 📝 Configuration Files
- docker-compose.prod.yml: Production deployment with nginx/SSL support
- nginx/nginx.conf: Main nginx configuration
- nginx/conf.d/default.conf: Domain and SSL routing rules
- deployment/setup-ssl.sh: Automated SSL setup script
- deployment/QUICK-SSL-SETUP.md: Step-by-step SSL guide
- DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md: Complete deployment documentation

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed backend port mapping (changed expose to ports)
- Removed obsolete docker-compose version field
- Fixed health check connectivity issues in CI/CD

### 🎯 Domain Setup
Prepared for mtauth.online with:
- api.mtauth.online → Backend API (HTTPS)
- mtauth.online → Frontend (HTTPS)
- Automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirect
- Certificate auto-renewal every 12 hours

### 📚 Documentation
- Created comprehensive deployment guide
- Added quick SSL setup instructions
- Documented Route53 + Namecheap DNS configuration
- Added troubleshooting guides

## Testing

All tests passing:
- ✅ Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- ✅ E2E tests
- ✅ Linting and code quality
- ✅ Docker build and push
- ✅ EC2 deployment

## Deployment

After merging, the backend will:
1. Auto-deploy to EC2 on port 3000 (HTTP)
2. Be ready for SSL setup with ./deployment/setup-ssl.sh
3. Support https://api.mtauth.online after DNS + SSL configuration

## Next Steps

1. Configure Route53 hosted zone for mtauth.online
2. Update Namecheap nameservers to Route53
3. Create A records (mtauth.online, api.mtauth.online, www.mtauth.online)
4. Wait for DNS propagation (1-2 hours)
5. Run setup-ssl.sh on EC2
6. Deploy with: docker compose --profile with-ssl up -d
